Wednesday, 6 March 2024.My name is Tan Yee Fong with matrix number, 23004901. I am  majoring in Multimedia Computing. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling depression about taking this subject. This is because coding can make me loss a lot of hair and I need to eat a lot of good stuff to cure my depression. I acquired C for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad (Oh Really?). So, I think I can manage to get A- (Too far)  for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will study hard, watch more YouTube, ask more ChatGPT and sleep less. Wish me luck!!!
